# ml5-lstm-chatbot-mutatis

A chatbot early early early version that uses LSTM to make some strange poetic conversations with you. 
Currently running on a model that learnt on Das Kapital's first two chapters. There are other version in the `models` folder. 

**The CSS is super horrible. Happy if someone can make commits to it.**

## Why this?
As part of a performance called Mutatis Mutandis, we were hoping that a simple gibberish chatbot could a character/entity within the play. Eventually just felt that we can deploy it on a browser on the visitors mobile phones instead of trying to struggle with complex tools build for enterprise levels.
